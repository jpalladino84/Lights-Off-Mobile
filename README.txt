Lights Off Mobile Game

Objective:

This is a Lights Out inspired game created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

My hope for this project is for the comminuty to help out and add features to it. Features will be disucessed and voted on
and milestones will be set up. After each milestone we will stablize the project and realease it onto the Apple App Store
and Google Play as a FREE app and NO ADs! 


iOS:
Currently the iOS Phone Gap project is created and ready to be pulled. If you would like to test iOS let me know and I can 
you to my Dev licence. 

Android:
I will be setting up the Android project hopefully in the next few days. 

Happy Coding!
